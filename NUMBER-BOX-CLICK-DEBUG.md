# Number Box Click Debug Summary

## Current Status
- âœ… All click handler connections verified
- âœ… Enhanced debug logging added 
- âœ… Development server running at http://127.0.0.1:5173

## Debug Steps to Follow

### 1. Open Browser Console
1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5173
2. Go to Rule-1 page
3. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
4. Go to Console tab

### 2. Look for Debug Messages
When you navigate to Rule-1 page, you should see:
- `ðŸŽ¨ renderNumberBoxesRobust called:` - Shows rendering is happening
- `ðŸ”— Setting click handler and rendering...` - Shows handler setup
- `âœ… Number boxes rendered:` - Confirms rendering completion

### 3. Test Number Box Clicks
Click on any number box and look for:
- `ðŸ”¢ handleNumberBoxClickRobust called:` - Shows click was detected
- Either success message or error details

### 4. Common Issues to Check

#### If no number boxes appear:
- Check for "Number box system initializing..." message
- Look for ABCD/BCD analysis data in debug logs
- Verify activeHR is set (should see HR buttons)

#### If number boxes appear but are disabled:
- Check console for eligibility messages
- Verify you're on 5th date or later
- Check if ABCD/BCD numbers exist for that date

#### If clicks don't register:
- Look for `ðŸ”¢ handleNumberBoxClickRobust called:` message
- Check if activeHR is set (should not be null/undefined)
- Look for any JavaScript errors in console

## Quick Fixes

### If activeHR is not set:
1. Click on one of the HR buttons (HR1, HR2, etc.)
2. This should activate the number boxes

### If ABCD/BCD data is missing:
1. Try switching to a different date
2. Check if data loaded properly for that topic

### If errors occur:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check network tab for failed API calls
3. Try different topic or date combination

The debug logs should now clearly show where the issue is occurring in the click chain!
