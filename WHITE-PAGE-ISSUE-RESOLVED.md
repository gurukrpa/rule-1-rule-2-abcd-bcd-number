# White Page Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
Application showing white page after cross-page sync implementation.

## Root Cause
Incorrect import statement in `src/services/crossPageSyncService.js`:

### ❌ Incorrect (Causing Error)
```javascript
import { CleanSupabaseService } from './CleanSupabaseService.js';
// ...
this.cleanSupabaseService = new CleanSupabaseService();
```

### ✅ Correct (Fixed)
```javascript
import cleanSupabaseService from './CleanSupabaseService.js';
// ...
this.cleanSupabaseService = cleanSupabaseService;
```

## Explanation
- `CleanSupabaseService.js` exports a singleton instance as default export
- The file exports `cleanSupabaseService` (instance), not `CleanSupabaseService` (class)
- Trying to import the class name as a named import caused a module resolution error
- This error cascaded up through the import chain, causing React app to fail loading

## Resolution Steps
1. ✅ Identified that `crossPageSyncService.js` was empty (manually edited)
2. ✅ Recreated the service file with correct functionality
3. ✅ Fixed the import statement to use default import
4. ✅ Verified app loads correctly

## Status
- **Issue**: RESOLVED ✅
- **App Status**: WORKING ✅
- **Cross-Page Sync**: FUNCTIONAL ✅

## Verification
- ✅ Dev server running without errors
- ✅ Main application loads successfully
- ✅ No console errors in browser
- ✅ All service imports working correctly

The application is now fully functional with the cross-page synchronization feature intact.
