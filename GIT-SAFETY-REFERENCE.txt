📋 GIT SAFETY QUICK REFERENCE
===============================

🛡️ YOUR PROTECTED WORKING APP
Branch: checkpoint-for-revert-application
Backup: working-app-backup

✅ SAFE COMMANDS (Always Use These):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
./safe-git.sh safe-pull           # Check for remote changes safely
./safe-git.sh safe-checkout dev   # Switch branches safely  
./safe-git.sh emergency-restore   # 🚨 RESTORE WORKING APP
./safe-git.sh status              # Check protection status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ DANGEROUS COMMANDS (Never Use These):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
git pull origin main              # Could break your app
git checkout main                 # Would switch to broken code
git merge main                    # Could overwrite your working code
git pull                          # Might pull broken code
git rebase                        # Could mess up your history
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 PANIC BUTTON - IF YOUR APP BREAKS:
./safe-git.sh emergency-restore

💡 MEMORY TRICK:
- Start with "./safe-git.sh" = SAFE
- Raw "git" commands = DANGEROUS
- "emergency-restore" = PANIC BUTTON

📱 QUICK COMMANDS:
./safe-git.sh                     # Show all available commands
./protect-working-app.sh          # Re-activate protection
