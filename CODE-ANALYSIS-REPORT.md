### üßÆ Code Complexity Analysis

#### High Complexity Components (>1000 lines)
- These are your main feature components handling complex astrological calculations
- Consider breaking into smaller, focused sub-components
- Rule1 and Planets analysis pages are the most complex

#### Medium Complexity (500-1000 lines)
- Core functionality components like UserData, NumberGen
- Well-sized for their functionality

#### Service Layer Complexity
- Multiple data services suggest evolution of data handling approach
- Main dataService (846 lines) is the core data handler
- Supabase services provide database abstraction

### üí° Code Quality Insights

#### Strengths
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between components, services, and utilities
- **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Covers authentication, data management, analysis, and UI
- **Database Abstraction**: Multiple service layers for flexibility

#### Areas for Optimization
1. **Large Components**: Consider splitting Rule1Page_Enhanced (1,795 lines) and PlanetsAnalysisPage (1,768 lines)
2. **Service Consolidation**: You have multiple data services that could potentially be unified
3. **Utility Organization**: Good utility structure supporting complex calculations

### üéØ Application Scope
