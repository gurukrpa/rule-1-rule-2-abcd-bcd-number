# üéØ Create Supabase Automation Project - Step by Step Guide

## üéØ Current Issue
You have placeholder URLs in `.env.automation` instead of a real Supabase staging project.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Create New Supabase Project
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard
   ```

2. **Create New Project**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Click "New Project"
   ‚Ä¢ Organization: Select your organization
   ‚Ä¢ Project Name: "viboothi-automation" or "viboothi-staging"
   ‚Ä¢ Database Password: Create a strong password (save it!)
   ‚Ä¢ Region: Same as your production project (closest to your users)
   ‚Ä¢ Pricing Plan: Free tier is fine for staging
   ```

3. **Wait for Project Creation**
   ```
   ‚è≥ This takes 2-3 minutes
   ‚òï Go grab a coffee while it sets up
   ```

### Step 2: Get Project Configuration
1. **Go to Project Settings**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Click on your new project
   ‚Ä¢ Go to Settings (gear icon in sidebar)
   ‚Ä¢ Click "API" in the left menu
   ```

2. **Copy the Configuration**
   ```
   You'll need these values:
   ‚Ä¢ Project URL
   ‚Ä¢ Project API Keys (anon/public key)
   ‚Ä¢ Service Role Key (optional, for admin operations)
   ```

### Step 3: Update .env.automation
Replace the placeholder values in `.env.automation` with your real staging credentials:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Automation Database)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ANON_KEY
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

### Step 4: Set Up Database Schema
Your automation project needs the same database structure as production.

**Option A: Manual Setup**
1. Go to SQL Editor in your new project
2. Copy the schema from your production project
3. Run the SQL to create tables

**Option B: Migration Script (I can help create this)**
We can create a script to automatically set up the schema.

### Step 5: Test the Automation Environment
```bash
# Switch to automation environment
./switch-environment.sh automation

# Test the connection
npm run dev

# Check that it connects to your new staging Supabase project
```

---

## üéØ Quick Start Commands

After creating the Supabase project, you'll run:

```bash
# 1. Edit the automation environment file
nano .env.automation

# 2. Replace placeholder URLs with real staging project URLs

# 3. Test the automation environment
./switch-environment.sh automation
npm run dev

# 4. Verify in browser that you see the yellow automation banner
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Approach is Safe

1. **Complete Isolation**: Your production Supabase project (`zndkprjytuhzufdqhnmt`) remains untouched
2. **Separate Data**: Staging project has its own database, completely isolated
3. **Environment Switching**: Easy to switch between production and staging
4. **Visual Warnings**: Yellow banner prevents confusion between environments

---

## üéØ Next Steps After Project Creation

1. Create the Supabase automation project (2-3 minutes)
2. Update `.env.automation` with real credentials
3. Set up database schema in staging project
4. Test automation environment
5. Deploy to staging when ready
